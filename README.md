<p> Hello my name is Nataliia.

I've got a good feedback on the Dare IT Challenge from a friend of mine, so I decided to take part in this program.</p>
<p>I believe that this is a good opportunity to expand my knowledge about testing and start my path as a specialist in this field. I consider the advice of experts to be a significant help in this. Participation in the Dare IT Challenge is also a valuable opportunity to join the community of testers and gain experience as an Automation/Manual tester. During the Challenge, I expect to create a testing project that would contribute to my portfolio.</p>
